#####Self-Evaluation Rubric

-Functionality
_I believe this project meets the requirements of at least a "3". I may have some time to further implement a cracking method and CLI for it. All required methods and CLI interfaces are fully functional, and I may include additional features beyond the spec later._
-Object-Oriented Programming
_Regarding OOP, my Enigma project is somewhere between a "3" and a "4". Not only is it broken into clear and readable classes, the methods are quite short compared to my previous work, no class is longer than even 50 lines, and SRP and DRY can be seen throughout each class and method. Furthermore, the project includes use of a module class called "Algorithm", which helps keep things simple and readable. Variable and method names are succinct and appropriate._
-Test-Driven Development
_TDD in this project is just short of a "4". Although I did not implement mocks and stubs yet, SimpleCov shows 100% coverage and tests are comprehensive. Tests are provided at the unit and integration levels, allowing full functionality to be tested and verified. Test names communicate clearly what their purpose is. Git history demonstrates that tests were written before methods were built. Tests had to be modified later in the development of the project due to a class separation refactor, but the tests had already been constructed at the time, indicating strong TDD._
-Version Control
_I believe this project meets the requirements of a "3" for version control. There are a significant number of commits, each with a clear message illustrating their purpose and why they are necessary. History demonstrates TDD. Pull requests could have been committed in smaller chunks, which, to be honest, is why I believe version control on my project is not deserving of a "4". However, commit messages are explicit and lucid, and well-documented._
